6. Configure settings:
	
	Fill in GUI fields.

	Under Reddit Credentials:

		"Enter your username and password".

			e.g.,

			swedishbotmafia
			*************

	Under Email Credentials:

		I used Gmail for this although it is possible to use other email services by altering the SMTP server field (advanced users only).

		"Enter email username and password."

			e.g.,

			swedishbotmafia@gmail.com
			*************


		"To email addresses" have to be separated by commas.

			e.g., 

			swedishbotmafia@gmail.com,youremail@wherever.net,thisemailtoo@yahoo.com

	Under Settings:

		Under "subreddits" enter the subreddits you would like the bot to check separated by commas.

			e.g., 

			all,news,worldnews,politics

		Under "words to track" enter the words you would like to track (remember to add a space after each word or RScanBot will return words containing that string of characters, I believe it's possible to look for hash tags on reddit with this bot as well.)

			e.g., 

			united states ,israel ,united kingdom ,hippies ,hoodies ,sweat pants ,#swedishbotmafia 

		Under "Number of posts to retrieve" enter the number of hot posts to retrieve from each subreddit to check.
		caveats, the higher this number the slower the first run is. Subsequent runs are faster because the bot remembers what it has already checked. I put the default at 100 but you can change this to whatever you wish.

			e.g,

			20

		Under "Minutes to wait betweeen runs" enter the number of minutes to wait between runs. I find 30 minutes to be nice but this can be adjusted at will.

			e.g,

			90

	Press "Update Settings" when done.

	(tip: if you update settings after you have started the bot you will have to press stop bot and restart the bot program for your settings to take effect)

7. Start the Bot:
	
	press "Start Bot"

8. Watch bot progress:

	There should be a terminal window on your screen that will show the bot as it is running. If you close this window the bot wil stop/exit so minimize. Bot will also stop/exit if you hit stop bot, or close the bot gui screen so also minimize this if you don't wish to see it.
